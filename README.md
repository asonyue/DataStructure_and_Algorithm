Implementing Data Structure and Algorithm using C

## (Part 1) Single Link List Implementation

### Create:
It creates a single node with user's value provided.

### InsertTail
It inserts node in the tail position.

### Display:
When the current pointer pointed to a node that is not NULL,
It will continuously to print out the value of each node and
move the current pointer to the next node.

### Count:
It counts the number of nodes in the link list.

### Sum:
It counts the sums in the link list. 

### Max:
It find out the max element in the link list.

### LSearch:
This function is used to search through the link list to see
if the targeted value existed or not and return the value if
it is found, else return NULL.

### Insert
It insert the desired node in desired position.

### Delete
It deletes the desired node in the given position.

### Reverse
It reverses the whole link list

### mergeSorted
It merges two sorted link list in ascending order.
